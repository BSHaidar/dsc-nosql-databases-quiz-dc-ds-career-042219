    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can't clearly define a size of a column and how it links to other tables, it means that they are not ideal fit for a relational database and it is is best to use a NoSQL database. In a SQL database, you know the structure of your database, relationship between tables, and field datatypes. Additionally, everything must be defined and implemented in a SQL database before we can add any data to the database. Another major difference is that structure and space is allocated at the onset of SQL databases and unlike NoSQL database space is consumed on the fly, meaning space is allocated as we store information and not before hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example is many of the social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Chats, posts, and pictures for example cannot be defined in terms of size, number, occurrence and can vary wildely from user to user. To account for this wide and non-deterministic variance using a NoSQL database is an ideal solution for this scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "In our chat example in question 2, we can evisage that a chat can be arbitrarily long or short and cannot be defined in terms of size or length ahead of time. Mongo DB uses a document store database and stores every document - a chat in our example - as a key-value pair same as a dictionnary in python. These documents can contain other documents inside of them and can be created dynamically as more chats are produced and stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in question 2, RDBMS requires the database creator to know all the datatypes, size, tables, and relationship before crafting their database and therefore lacks the flexibility of a Mongo DB but on the other hand, you know your schema in an RDBMS while in NoSQL DB every document can have its own schema so it makes data querying and retrieval a lot harder. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault tolerance is essentially a way to deal with failure, like an unavailable server, a database being unaccessible, and have a way to deal with these unexpected failures to maximize up time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Resilient Distribute Datasets have neat way with its built-in fault tolerance approach. For example, if we have 3 databases X, Y, and Z, it would run database X on server1 and store Y and Z databases on server1 for backup, redundancy, and fault tolerance. Similarly, server2 will host Y database and will store X and Z on it. Finally, server3 hosts Z and X, Y are there as backup. At any point a server or a database becomes unaccessible, another server can take its place and pull the backed up database to create a seamless and full-tolerant solution so their user base remain unaffected it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop uses a MapReduce approach. When we ask each server to run some query or function at the same time this is the Map step, and then combining the the results from each server into a single aggregate this is the Reduce step. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
